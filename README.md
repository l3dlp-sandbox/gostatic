# gostatic

Gostatic is a static site generator. It tracks file changes during compilation,
which is why it works reasonably [fast](#speed). Also it provides framework for
[configuration](#configuration) akin to Make, which makes it easy to understand
and to write custom configurations.

Features include:

 - No run-time dependencies, just a single binary - [download](https://github.com/piranha/gostatic/releases/) it and run
 - Dependency tracking and re-rendering only changed pages
 - Markdown support - [Commonmark](https://commonmark.org/) via [goldmark](https://github.com/yuin/goldmark/)
 - Simple [config syntax](#configuration)
 - Flexible [filter system](#processors)
 - Support for pagination
 - Plays well with external commands and scripts
 - HTTP server and watcher (instant rendering on changes)
 - Suitable for automation (ability to query state with `gostatic --dump`)

And all in all, it works nicely for me, so it may work for you!

## Installation

If you're Go user and want to install this from source, you know what to do (`go
get` it).

In other case, download a binary from
[releases page](https://github.com/piranha/gostatic/releases) - which also
serves as **CHANGELOG**.

If you need to automate downloading latest release, I use this script (change
`64-linux` to the type you need):

```
URL=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/piranha/gostatic/releases | awk '/download_url.*64-linux/ { print $2; exit }')
curl -Lso gostatic $(URL)
chmod +x gostatic
```

When downloading in Macos, your file will be quarantined and to use it you'll
have to assure Macos you know what you're doing:

```
xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine gostatic
```

## Quick Start

Run `gostatic -i my-site` to generate basic site in directory `my-site`. It will
have a basic `config` file, which you should edit to put relevant variables at
the top - it also contains description of how files in your `src` directory are
treated.

`src` directory obviously contains sources of your site (name of this directory
can be changed in `config`). You can follow general idea of this directory to
create new blog posts or new pages. All files, which are not mentioned in
`config`, are just copied over. Run `gostatic -fv config` to see how your `src`
is processed.

`site.tmpl` is a file that defines templates your are able to use for your
pages. You can see those templates mentioned in `config`.

And, finally, there is a `Makefile`, just for convenience. Run `make` to build
your site once or `make w` to run watcher and server, to see your site changes
in real time.

Also, you could look at [my site](https://github.com/piranha/solovyov.net) for
an example of advanced usage.

Good luck! And remember, your contributions either to gostatic or to
documentation (even if it's just this `README.md`) are always very welcome!

## Approach

Each given file is processed through a pipeline of filters, which modify the
file state and then rendered on disk. Single input file corresponds to a single
output file, but filters can generate virtual input files (like tag files).

File is rendering in those cases:

- output file does not exists
- file source is newer than it's output
- one of those is the case for one of file's dependencies

All files are sorted by date. This date is taken in their [config](#page-config)
or, in case if date in config is absent or dates there are equal, by file
modification time.

## Speed

| Box                       | Pages |  Full |  Noop |      Single post |
|:--------------------------|------:|------:|------:|-----------------:|
| Macbook Air '15 (i7)      |   630 | 450ms | 100ms | 160ms (93 pages) |
| Macbook Air '15 (i7)      |   250 | 180ms |   n/a |              n/a |
| Macbook Air '20 (M1)      |   486 | 185ms |  39ms | 140ms (97 pages) |
| Hetzner CX21 (2 vCPU/4GB) |   486 | 502ms |  89ms | 414ms (97 pages) |

This are results of forced full site rebuild, then checking there are no
modification, and then re-rendering a single changed page (along with pages
which depend on this page).

Also note that if you're using various external post-processors (like uglifyjs
or sassc) they tend to slow down things a bit (for my specific use case both
uglifyjs and sassc add another `0.25s` when files they process change).

To reproduce numbers, [download hyperfine][], [download gostatic][], clone
[solovyov.net][], comment out `:google-closure-compiler` in `config` and then run:

- `hyperfine 'gostatic -f config'`
- `hyperfine 'gostatic config'`
- `hyperfine 'touch src/blog/2017/fuji-raw.md && gostatic config'`

## Configuration

Config syntax is Makefile-inspired with some simplifications, look at the
example:

```Makefile
TEMPLATES = site.tmpl templates-folder
SOURCE = src
OUTPUT = site

# this is a comment
*.md:
    config
    ext .html
    directorify
    tags tags/*.tag
    markdown
    template page # yeah, this is a comment as well

index.md: blog/*.md
    config
    ext .html
    inner-template
    markdown
    template page

*.tag: blog/*.md
    ext .html
    directorify
    template tag
    markdown
    template page
```

Here we have constants declaration (first three lines), a comment and then three
rules. One for any markdown file, one specifically for index.md and one for
generated tags.

Specific rules override generic matching rules, but logic is not exactly very
smart, and there is no real precedence defined, so if you have several matches
for a single file you could end up with any of them. Note that there is some
order: exact path match, exact name match, glob path match, glob name
match. NOTE: this may change in future.

Rules consist of path/match, list of dependencies (also paths and matches, the
ones listed after colon) and commands.

Each command consists of a name of processor and (possibly) some
arguments. Arguments are separated by spaces.

Note: if a file has no rules whatsoever, it will be copied to exactly same
location at destination as it was in source without being read into memory. So
heavy images etc shouldn't be a problem.

### Constants

There are three configuration constants:

- `SOURCE` - sources to read (relative to location of config)
- `OUTPUT` - directory for output (relative to location of config)
- `TEMPLATES` - list of files and/or directories (containing `*.tmpl` files),
which will be parsed as Go templates. Each file can contain more than one
template (see [docs](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/#hdr-Nested_template_definitions)
on that).

You can also use arbitrary names for constants to
[access later](#site-interface) from templates - just use any other name
(`AUTHOR` could be one).

All constants can also be accessed from the config itself, using
`$(CONSTANT_NAME)` syntax, just like in `Makefile`.

## Page Config

Page config is only processed if you specify `config` processor for a page. It's
format is `name: value`, for example:

```
title: This is a page
tags: test
date: 2013-01-05
```

Parsed properties:

- `title` - page title.
- `tags` - list of tags, separated by `,`.
- `date` - page date, could be used for blog. Accepts formats from bigger to
  smaller (from `"2006-01-02 15:04:05 -07"` to `"2006-01-02"`)
- `hide` - false if not specified or is one of `f`, `false`, `False`,
  `FALSE`. True in other cases. Hides page from children and tag lists when true.

You can also define any other property you like, it's value will be treated as a
string and it's key is capitalized and put on the `.Other`
[page property](#page-interface).

## Processors

You can always check list of available processors with `gostatic --processors`.

- `config` - reads config from content. Config should be in format "name: value"
  and separated by four dashes on empty line (`----`) from content.

- `ignore` - ignore file.

- `rename <new-name>` - rename a file to `new-name`. Note this does not change
  path to a file (you can use `..`, though, but be careful about platform
  differences). If `new-name` contains `*`, then it'll be replaced with content
  of `*` from path match. For example, with `blog/*.md: rename ../blog-*.html`
  this will rename `blog/one.html` to `blog-one.html`.

- `ext <.ext>` - change file extension to a given one (which should be prefixed
  with a dot).

- `datefilename` - rename a file from `whatever/2021-02-08-name.html` to
  `whatever/name.html` and set the `page.Date` to `2021-02-08`.

- `directorify` - rename a file from `whatever/name.html` to
  `whatever/name/index.html`.

- `markdown` - process content as Markdown.  
  `markdown` without any arguments will not do any code-block highlighting.  
  `markdown chroma=monokai` will use the [Chroma][chroma] highlighter to highlight code blocks, using the Monokai style, with inline CSS styles. (No .css file needed).  
  You can see the styles at the [Chroma style previewer][chromaStyles1].  
  The official list of styles is in the [Chroma repo here][chromaStyles2].

[chroma]: https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma
[chromaStyles1]: https://xyproto.github.io/splash/docs/
[chromaStyles2]: https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma/tree/master/styles

- `inner-template` - process content as Go template.

- `template <name>` - pass page to a template named `<name>`.

- `tags <path-pattern>` - create a virtual page for all tags of a current
  page. This tag page has path formed by replacing `*` in `<path-pattern>` with
  a tag name and has a tag as its `.Title` (use `{{ range .Site.Pages.WithTag
  .Title }}...{{end}}` to get a list of tagged pages.

- `relativize` - change all urls archored at `/` to be relative (i.e. add
  appropriate amount of `../`) so that generated content can be deployed in a
  subfolder of a site.

- `external <command> <args...>` - call external command with content of a page
  as stdin and using stdout as a new content of a page. Has a shortcut:
  `:<command> <args...>` (`:` is replaced with `external `).

- `paginate <n> <path-pattern>` - create a virtual page for each `n` of pages
  (grouped by `path-pattern`, so you can paginate few groups of pages as a
  single one). `path-pattern` has `*` replaced by an index of this virtual page
  (1-based), and you can get a list of pages with `{{ range paginator
  .}}...{{end}}` (see [paginator](#global-functions) function). Using `paginate`
  with the same `path-pattern` on different types of pages will group them in
  same paginated list (*request*: please open an
  [issue](https://github.com/piranha/gostatic/issues/new) if you have an idea
  how to phrase this better).

- `jekyllify` - creating pages in jekyll style, for example, the page
  `2018-02-02-name.md` will be converted to `/2018/02/02/name.md`.

- `yaml` - read the configuration for the page using yaml format (like jekyll).

## Template API Reference

Templating is provided using
[Go templates](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/). See link for documentation
on syntax.

Each template is executed in context of a [page](#page-interface). This means it
has certain properties and methods it can output or call to generate content,
i.e. `{{ .Content }}` will output page content in place.

### Global functions

Go template system provides some convenient
[functions](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/#hdr-Functions), and gostatic
expands on that a bit:

- `absurl <base> <url>` - given an url and a base will join them to something
  sane: leave the `<url>` in place if it's absolute, or resolve it within
  `<base>` if it's not.

- `changed <name> <value>` - checks if `<value>` has changed since previous call
  with the same name. Storage used for checking is global over the whole run of
  gostatic, so choose unique names for different places.

- `cut <begin> <end> <value>` - cut partial content from `<value>`, delimited
  by regular expressions `<begin>` and `<end>`.

- `hash <value>` - return 32-bit hash of a given value.

- `version <page> <path>` - return relative URL to a page with resulting path
  `<path>` with `?v=<32-bit hash>` appended (use to override cache settings for
  static files).

- `truncate <length> <value>` - truncate string to given length (if it's
  longer).

- `strip_html <value>` - remove all HTML tags from string.

- `strip_newlines <value>` - remove all line breaks and newlines from string.

- `trim <value>` - trim all whitespace ([strings.TrimSpace](https://golang.org/pkg/strings/#TrimSpace)).

- `replace <old> <new> <value>` - replace all occurrences of `old` with `new` in
  `value`.

- `replacen <old> <new> <n> <value>` - same as above, but only `n` times.

- `replacere <pattern> <replacement> <value>` - replace text in `value`
  according to [regexp](https://golang.org/pkg/regexp/syntax/) `pattern` and
  `replacement`.

- `split <separator> <value>` - split string by separator, generating an array
  (you can use `range` with result of this function).

- `contains <needle> <value>` - check if a string `value` contains `needle`.

- `starts <needle> <value>` - check if a string `value` starts with `needle`.

- `ends <needle> <value>` - check if a string `value` ends with `needle`.

- `matches <pattern> <value>` - check if a
  [regexp](https://golang.org/pkg/regexp/syntax/) `pattern` matches string `value`.

- `refind <pattern> <value>` - apply regexp `pattern` to a string `value` and
  return first submatch (the thing in parentheses), if any, or a whole matched
  string.

- `markdown <value>` - convert a string (`value`) from Markdown to HTML.

- `paginator <page>` - get a [paginator](#paginator-interface) object for
  current page (only works on pages created by `paginate` processor).

- `exec <cmd> [<arg1> <arg2> ....]` - exec a command with (optional) arguments.

- `exectext <cmd> [<arg1> <arg2> ....] <text>` - exec a command with (optional)
  arguments and last argument (presumably some text) bound to command's
  stdin. If you need to do something hard, use it like `{{ exectext "sh" "-c"
  "pipe | line" .Content }}`.

- `excerpt <text> <maxWordCount>` - Gets an excerpt from the given text, to a
  maximum of `maxWordCount` words. When the text is shortened, it will produce
  an `[...]` string, denoting there's more. For example, `The quick brown fox`
  with `maxWordCount` of 2 will result in `The quick [...]`.

- `even <n>` - tests if `n` is divisible by 2.

- `odd <n>` - tests if `n` is not divisible by 2.

- `count <text>` - returns a number of words in text.

- `reading_time <text>` - returns reading time based on [average reading speed
  being 200](https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/214991667-Read-time).

- `some <x> <x> <x>....` - returns first non-nil value as a string

- `dir <path>` - returns all but the last element of a path (same as [filepath.Dir](https://golang.org/pkg/path/filepath/#Dir))

- `base <path>` - returns the last element of a path (same as [filepath.Base](https://golang.org/pkg/path/filepath/#Base))

- `abcsort <pages>` - returns the pages sorted in alphabetical order of their .Name

## Extensibility

Obviously, the easiest way to extend gostatic's functionality is to use
`external` [processor](#processors). It makes you able to process files in the
way you want, but is more or less limited to that. There is no API right now to
create pages on the fly (like `tags` processor does) using this method, for
example.

But `gostatic` itself is a
[library](https://github.com/piranha/gostatic/tree/master/lib), and you can
write your own static site generator using this library. See
[gostatic.go](https://github.com/piranha/gostatic/blob/master/gostatic.go) for
an example of one.
